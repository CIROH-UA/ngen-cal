# ngiab-cal Docker Image

## What is this?

This repository contains a modified version of ngen-cal designed to work with NextGen In A Box (NGIAB). It provides calibration capabilities for hydrologic models through a containerized environment.

## Limitations
Understanding Docker containers and how to use `docker exec` is recommended if you need to troubleshoot.
1. **Limited Calibration Algorithms**: Currently only configured to use the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm. Other algorithms available in the main ngen-cal branch are not supported.

2. **Single-Gage Calibration**: Designed for calibrating single-basin models using one USGS streamgage. Multi-gage or multi-objective calibration is not supported *_by this branch_*.

4. **Custom ngen-cal Branch**: Uses a modified version of ngen-cal from the `ngiab_cal` branch, which differs from the main branch. Features from newer releases of ngen-cal may not be available.

5. **Compatibility Concerns**: The customized ngen-cal implementation may not be compatible with current and future changes to ngen-cal's main branch.

## How to use this

1. **Prepare your data directory** using the NGIAB data preprocessor:
   ```bash
   # Example command to create a basin configuration
   uvx --from ngiab_data_preprocess cli -i gage-10154200 -sfr --start 2010-01-01 --end 2015-02-28
   ```

   The preprocessor will create a directory structure with all the necessary files for model simulation.

2. **Run ngiab-cal** to set up the calibration environment:
   ```bash
   # Create calibration configuration
   uvx ngiab-cal ~/ngiab_preprocess_output/gage-10154200 -g 10154200

   # Or create and automatically run calibration
   uvx ngiab-cal ~/ngiab_preprocess_output/gage-10154200 -g 10154200 --run
   ```

3. **Manually run the Docker image** (if not using the `--run` flag):
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v "~/ngiab_preprocess_output/gage-10154200/:/ngen/ngen/data" joshcu/ngiab-cal:demo
   ```

4. **Check results** in the `calibration/Output` directory after running.

## Container Structure

- The Docker image is based on the NGIAB container with additional files for calibration
- `/calibration/` contains the ngen-cal code and scripts
- `/calibration/run.sh` is the entry point for running calibration
- Files from your data directory are mounted to `/ngen/ngen/data/`
- The NGIAB container's existing directories and tools are preserved

## The mpi-ngen Script

In this container, `mpi-ngen` is a script that replaces the NextGen binary to allow ngen serial commands to be run in parallel. It wraps `ngen-serial` with the necessary steps to run simulations with MPI, modified from the [NGIAB guide.sh script](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/blob/main/guide.sh).

## Modifying Calibration Parameters

To modify the calibration configuration parameters, you should:

1. Edit the configuration file in your calibration directory:
   ```
   ~/ngiab_preprocess_output/gage-XXXX/calibration/ngen_cal_conf.yaml
   ```

2. Be aware that running ngiab-cal with the `-f` flag will overwrite any manual changes.

## Custom Building

If you need to modify the container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/ngiab-cal.git
cd ngiab-cal
docker build -t ngiab-cal:custom .
```

Then use your custom image in place of `joshcu/ngiab-cal:demo`.
